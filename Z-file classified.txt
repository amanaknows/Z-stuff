1) All arbitrary trade data.
2) All flash loan data.
3) All positive potential receiving value transfers.
4) Counter malicious parties.
6) multiply counter party data against x data to multiply growth periods for coins 
7) implement "angel math" to turn initial to $150,000,000 asset value target. 
8) equal timing: 
- use 0x protocol to hold lack of liquidity from unexplained transaction
- repeat (1-6)
- send equal value of amanas value received back to 0x tool and/or other meta-protocol contibutors
- send agreed portions of gorilla trade to influencers of agreement outlined in song code
9) test and debug any conflicting objection to implement. 
10) only Amana is granted approval for use and alteration of angel implementation code
11) Implement and delete all trace of (Angel implement: "angel math")
gorilla trade" coding, recording, post song offer. run Lock "angel math" minted funds to wallets 
 @ ~ (01/01/2022 * x) x = 'Highest profit' + ('Lowest network collapse rate') = timing of 'RUN' 

 


Optimize to fit ruleset:

Borrow and/or create Future assurance liquidity pools to negate:
 'collapse rate'
noticeable chain variance
Alteration to timeline of financial transaction fulfillment

Also protect:

 Optimize ruleset to apply undiscovered real world variances of "ruleset"
 deploy to "flash loan" logic;
 "ruleset" must provide equal or greater outcome after complete. 
 (Apply aligning functions where needed. 

 Repay all debt and accidental loss from counter-party error.
